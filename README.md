This is a group project for the Operating Systems subject in UTN FRBA.
Teammates:
- Abril Caruso
- Guadalupe Fern√°ndez
- Franco Modesto
- Mora Rodriguez

The project consists of the simulation of different parts of a real operating system designed according to the theory we learnt in class and the specifications given by the evaluators. (https://docs.google.com/document/d/1orfThJsPmMx5uPzbY3wClGhqX8jASMOCUMlWnYAr7cA/edit)

Each module (Kernel, File System, Memory, CPU and multiple Consoles) consists of a process that communicates with the other parts through TCP/IP connections, using sockets, as seen in the following schema:
